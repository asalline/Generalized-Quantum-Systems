# Generalized-Quantum-Systems
-
One needs to open the main_gen2.m file in matlab to operate this script.

There is variables at the beginning of the code after the comments.

Example of the usage:
If one wants to optimize complex valued, rank 2, three qubit-system with three different measurement sets five times, one needs to write:

num_of_states = 2;
qudits = 3;
ranknum = 2;
real = 0;
repeats = 5;
rounds = 3;

If one wants to use 10 different random measurements, one writes that

wanted_meas = 10;

After that, one presses f5 and waits for the answer.
