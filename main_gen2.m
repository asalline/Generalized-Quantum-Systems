% There is seven variables. First four are related to the random density 
% matrix and the generalized Gell-Mann basis (GGB). The others are used
% to determine how and how many times the optimization happens again.
%   num_of_states: Determines how many states the qudits have. I.e. for
%                  qubits, num_of_states = 2. (Default: 2)
%   qudits:        Amount of qudits the random density matrix will have
%                  when constucted. (Default: 2)
%   ranknum:       Rank of the random density matrix. (Default: 1)
%   real:          Determines if the random density matrix has a real (1)
%                  or a complex (0) values. (Default: 0)
%   repeats:       Amount of times this script generates a new random
%                  density matrix and tries to optimize it. (Default: 1)
%   rounds:        Number of the different measurement sets generated.
%                  These sets are used to optimize the density matrix.
%   wanted_meas:   Amount of the measurements one wants to use when
%                  optimizing the density matrix. (Default: 15)
